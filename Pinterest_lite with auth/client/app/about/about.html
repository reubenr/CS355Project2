<div id="about">
    <p>Welcome to Pinterest Lite. Everything you hate about the internet but worse than the original. This site is a learning experiment for using the Angular framework and Node on the server. It has been a fun project to work on and I have learned a ton. The purpose of Pinterest Lite is to be able to post interesting pictures from around the internet onto Pinterest Lite and allow other users of the site to view the pictures and your description of them. Users can choose to follow your postings so they can easily see what you have posted lately. The site is straight forward and easy to use</p>
    <p>This site is was developed by Reuben Romandy for the enjoyment of anybody who ever gets their hands on the source code. I don't envision it becoming a public site in the future since it is a complete rip off of the idea of Pinterest and is no where near ready for people to use or to scale.</p><p>Reuben can be reached if you know him personally or at the following email address which he only has in order to complete online forms which will spam him incessently reubmandy@gmail.com. If you send an email here nobody will ever see it.</p>
